# Hand-Gestures-to-assign-computer-tasks-using-contours-convex-hull-and-defect-points

Converting hand gesture into binary image and calculating the biggest contour fitting the hand image. Creating a convex hull around the contour with maximum area to detect bulged in points in this convex polygon. Using convexity defects to calculate the start and end points and maximum distance to the defect point storing them in a python list. Using cosine rule to calculate the angle between the two fingers to detect whether there is a defect point or not for each entry in python list. Assigning computer tasks on the basis of number of defect points detected in the image.

# REQUIREMENTS

* OpenCV version 2 or above
* Python version 3.0 or above
